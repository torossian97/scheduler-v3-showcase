## TL;DR

The intercative product showcase I made for the launch of Nylas Scheduler v3.

[Demo here](https://scheduler-v3-showcase.vercel.app/)

## The Problem

Uncertainty about what the new, re-imaged scheduler would be capable of. How could it be used, and what did component-ization mean for the future of the product?

## The Solution

An interactive showcase of use-cases, complete with code examples, that highlighted the best of the new set of components.

The APIs were entirely mocked to make this happen using Mock Service Workers.

## The Outcome

- Used in many technical enablements
- Used by marketing to create product tours
- Used by many customers to get up and running, and to get a quick snapshot of what's possible with the new Scheduler.

## Running it

- pull it
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
